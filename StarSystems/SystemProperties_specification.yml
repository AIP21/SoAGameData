description: Short description/info text about the system

(Object Name):
  type: Orbit path type, determining the appearance of the orbit, object position marker and selector. The color values can be modified in PathColors.yml.
    # Barycenter - The colors are taken from its binary component A type and used for the barycenter marker cross, selector and orbit
    # Star - used for all kinds of stellar and substellar objects
    # Planet - used for planetary-mass satellites of stars
    # DwarfPlanet - used for spherical satellites of stars with a mass <2.5e+22 kg
    # Moon - used for spherical satellites of planets
    # DwarfMoon - used for irregular satellites of planets in regular, usually resonant orbits
    # IrregularDwarfMoon - used for irregular satellites of planets in irregular orbits (captured asteroids). Orbits and name labels are only shown on mouse hover or when selected.
    # Asteroid - used for irregular satellites of stars. Orbits and name labels are only shown on mouse hover or when selected.
  comps: ["compNameA", "compNameB"] - The binary components of a barycenter
  path: Path of the object properties yaml file within the star system folder
  par: parent object
    # static - Fixed objects in space with no orbit use this as parent, the distance (in ly) and position (right ascension in h / declination in °) relative to our sun is looked up in Stars.tsv
  t: Orbital period in s
  ref: Orbital period reference body
  tf: Reference body period factor
  td: Reference body period divisor
  e: Eccentricity
  p: Longitude of the periapsis in °
  i: Inclination in °
  n:  Longitude of the ascending node in °
  a: Mean anomaly (starting position) in °
  trojan: Position of co-orbital objects, uses the same period and orbital parameters than its orbital reference body, only modifies the anomaly.
    # L4 - Trojan occupying lagrangian point 4 of the reference bodies orbit (a+60°)
    # L5 - Trojan occupying lagrangian point 5 of the reference bodies orbit (a-60°)
  mass: Mass in kg
  diameter: Mean equatorial diameter in km
  aTilt: Axial tilt of the rotation axis in °
  lNorth: Longitude of the north of the rotation axis in ° (not required if aTilt=0°)
  rotationalPeriod: Rotational period in h (not used for tidal-locked objects)
