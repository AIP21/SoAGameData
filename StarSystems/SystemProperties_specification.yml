description: Short description/info text about the system

### The orbit path type / path color is auto-detected for each object:
    # For barycenters, the colors are taken from its binary component A type and used for the barycenter marker cross, selector and orbit
    # Star - used for all kinds of stellar and substellar objects (ObjectType=star in their properties file)
    # Planet - used for planetary-mass satellites of stars (ObjectType=planet or ObjectType=gasGiant)
    # DwarfPlanet - used for spherical satellites of stars with a mass <2.5e+22 kg (ObjectType=planet)
    # Moon - used for spherical satellites of planets (ObjectType=planet or ObjectType=gasGiant)
    # DwarfMoon - used for irregular satellites of planets, which are resonant with other moons (ObjectType=asteroid)
    # IrregularDwarfMoon - used for irregular satellites of planets with no orbital resonance defined (ObjectType=asteroid). Orbits and name labels are only shown on mouse hover or when selected.
    # Asteroid - used for irregular satellites of stars (ObjectType=asteroid). Orbits and name labels are only shown on mouse hover or when selected.

(Object Name):
  barycenter: [compNameA, compNameB] - The binary components of a binary barycenter
  path: Path of the object properties yaml file within the star system folder
  par: parent object
    # static - Fixed objects in space with no orbit use this as parent, the distance (in ly) and position (right ascension in h / declination in °) relative to our sun is looked up in Stars.tsv
  t: Orbital period in s
  ref: Orbital period reference body
  tf: Reference body period factor
  td: Reference body period divisor
  e: Eccentricity
  p: Longitude of the periapsis in °
  i: Inclination in °
  n:  Longitude of the ascending node in °
  a: Mean anomaly (starting position) in °
  trojan: Position of co-orbital objects, uses the same period and orbital parameters than its orbital reference body, only modifies the anomaly
    # L4 - Trojan occupying lagrangian point 4 of the reference bodies orbit (a+60°)
    # L5 - Trojan occupying lagrangian point 5 of the reference bodies orbit (a-60°)
