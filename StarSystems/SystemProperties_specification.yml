# description: Short description/info text about the system
# age: The system age in years ("age: 0" is equivalent to "zero-age main sequence" for the stars in the system)

(Object Name):
  # type: Basic object type determining the appearance of the orbits, object markers and selectors. The color values can be modified in PathColors.yml
    # Barycenter - The colors are taken from its binary component A type and used for the barycenter marker cross, selector and orbit
    # Star - used for all kinds of stellar and substellar objects
    # Planet - used for planetary-mass satellites of stars
    # DwarfPlanet - used for not-mass-dominating spherical satellites of stars, usually located within asteroid belts (masses of <2e+22 kg)
    # Moon - used for larger, spherical satellites of planets
    # DwarfMoon - used for smaller, irregular satellites of planets
    # Asteroid - used for irregular satellites of stars, with densities >0.5 g/cm³. Orbits and name labels are only shown on mouse hover or when selected.
    # Comet - used for irregular satellites of stars, with densities <0.5 g/cm³. Orbits and name labels are only shown on mouse hover or when selected.
  # comps: Binary components [compNameA, compNameB]
  # path: Path of the object properties yaml file within the star system folder
  # par: parent object
    # static - Fixed objects in space with no orbit use this as parent
  # RA: Position of static objects relative to our sun, right ascension in °
  # Dec: Position of static objects relative to our sun, declination in °
  # dist:  Distance of static objects from our sun in ly
  # t: Orbital period in s
  # ref: Orbital period reference body
  # tf: Reference body period factor
  # td: Reference body period divisor
  # e: Eccentricity
  # p: Longitude of the periapsis in °
  # i: Inclination in °
  # n:  Longitude of the ascending node in °
  # a: Mean anomaly (starting position) in °
  # trojan: Position of co-orbital objects, uses the same period and orbital parameters than its orbital reference body, only modifies the anomaly
    # L4 - Trojan occupying lagrangian point 4 of the reference bodies orbit (a+60°)
    # L5 - Trojan occupying lagrangian point 5 of the reference bodies orbit (a-60°)
