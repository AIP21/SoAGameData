##########  Specifications for the object property files - last updated: 21.02.2016

### The object type name displayed in-game is (by default) auto-detected based on following conditions:
    # Stars use StarTypeNames.tsv as an expandable reference table for their various names (supported colors / spectral classes: T, L, M, K, G, F, A, B, O)
    # Gas Giant:    OrbitPathType = "Planet", ObjectType = "gasGiant", mass = 50 mE - 25 mJ
    # Ice Giant:    OrbitPathType = "Planet", ObjectType = "gasGiant", mass <50 mE
    # Ice Planet:    OrbitPathType = "Planet", ObjectType = "planet", density <2.5 g/cm³
    # Silicate Planet:    OrbitPathType = "Planet", ObjectType = "planet", density ≥2.5 and <5.0 g/cm³
    # Terrestrial Planet:    OrbitPathType = "Planet", ObjectType = "planet", density ≥5.0 and <7.5 g/cm³
    # Iron Planet:    OrbitPathType = "Planet", ObjectType = "planet", density ≥7.5 g/cm³
    # Giant Gas Moon:    OrbitPathType = "Moon", ObjectType = "gasGiant", mass = 50 mE - 200 mE
    # Giant Ice Moon:    OrbitPathType = "Moon", ObjectType = "gasGiant", mass <50 mE
    # Ice Moon:    OrbitPathType = "Moon", ObjectType = "planet", density <2.5 g/cm³
    # Silicate Moon:    OrbitPathType = "Moon", ObjectType = "planet", density ≥2.5 and <5.0 g/cm³
    # Terrestrial Moon:    OrbitPathType = "Moon", ObjectType = "planet", density ≥5.0 and <7.5 g/cm³
    # Iron Moon:    OrbitPathType = "Moon", ObjectType = "planet", density ≥7.5 g/cm³
    # Dwarf Planet:    OrbitPathType = "DwarfPlanet"
    # Dwarf Moon:    OrbitPathType = "DwarfMoon"
    # Irregular Dwarf Moon:    OrbitPathType = "IrregularDwarfMoon"
    # Asteroid:    OrbitPathType = "Asteroid", density ≥0.5 g/cm³
    # Comet:    OrbitPathType = "Asteroid", density <0.5 g/cm³

### General properties used for all objects:
(ObjectType):
  type: (Type Name) - Optional, overrides the auto-detected object type names
  # "type" can be used to add exotic types of planets like carbon planets, helium planets, gas dwarfs, etc or to add non-main sequence stars that don't fit into StarData.tsv
  diameter: The mean equatorial diameter in km, required for asteroids and planets, optional for stars and brown dwarfs (unless a custom type is used)
  mass: Required, the mass in kg
  aTilt: Required, the axial tilt in °
  lNorth: Longitude of the north in °, not required if aTilt=0°
  rotationalPeriod: The rotation period in h, required for asteroids and planets, optional for stars and brown dwarfs (unless a custom type is used), not used for tidal-locked objects
  rings: - Optional, array for planet rings
    - innerRadius: Radius of the inner ring edge in km
      outerRadius: Radius of the outer ring edge in km
       rTilt: Ring tilt in ° relative to the planet equator
       lNorth: Longitude of the north in °, not required if rTilt=0°
       colorLookup:(path of ring color map)



### Properties specific to object types:

asteroid:
  # Uses the general properties listed above, the irregular body shape and craters are procedurally generated, the composition is approximated from the density

planet:
  # Used for solid, spherical planets with procedural voxel terrain generation and biome support
  generation: (path of planet gen file)
  atmosphere: - Optional, planet atmosphere properties
    scaleDepth: ?
    kr: ?
    km: ?
    g: ?
    waveLength: [R, G, B] - light scattering color of the atmosphere
  clouds: - Optional, can only be used if an atmosphere is present
    color: ?
    scale: ?
    density: ?

gasGiant:
  # Used for gas planets like gas giants or ice giants
  oblateness: Required, the oblateness (polar flattening) of the gas planet, polar diameter = equatorial diameter * (1 - oblateness) 
  colorMap: (path of gas planet color map)
  atmosphere: - Required, gas planets without atmospheres are not possible!
    scaleDepth: ?
    kr: ?
    km: ?
    g: ?
    waveLength: [R, G, B] - light scattering color of the atmosphere

star:
  # Used for stellar and substellar objects
  # If optional data (diameter, temperature, rot. period) are missing, the game generates a random star based on its mass and the respective data given in StarData.tsv
  # Supported luminosity / spectral classes and subclasses (auto-detected based on the object mass):
    # V (L0, M, K, G, F, A, B, O) - Main Sequence, automatically uses the main sequence rendering type (small convection zones and star spots)
    # Vb (L) - Brown Dwarf, automatically uses the brown dwarf rendering type (random, dark cloud patches and large convection zones)
    # Vc (T) - Cool Brown Dwarf, uses the cool brown dwarf rendering type (dark cloud bands, similar to gas giants)
  surfaceTemperature: Optional, photosphere temperature in K
  starSpots: <true | false> Optional, enables/disables star spots (true by default)
