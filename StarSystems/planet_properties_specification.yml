##########  Specifications for the planet property files - last updated: 17.05.2016

planet:
# Used for solid, spherical planets with procedural voxel terrain generation and biome support
  surfacePressure: Optional, the zero-level / sea-level atmospheric surface pressure in mbar
  atmosphere: - Optional, general atmosphere properties (only used if surfacePressure > 0)
    scaleDepth: ?
    kr: ?
    km: ?
    g: ?
    waveLength: [R, G, B] - light scattering color of the atmosphere
    composition: [N2, O2, CO2, NO2, SO2, H2O, CH4, NH3, H2, He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe] - Optional, determines the composition of the atmosphere by weight numbers
    # Optional, but only used if surfacePressure > 0. Defaults to Earth's atmosphere (dry) for voxel planets.
    # The volume fraction of each gas is calculated by dividing its weight number by the sum of all weight numbers
    # The partial pressure of each gas at a certain height is calculated by multiplying total atmospheric pressure with the volume fraction of the gas
  clouds: - Optional, properties of the clouds (only used if surfacePressure > 0)
    color: ?
    scale: ?
    density: ?
  rings: - Optional, array for planet rings
    - innerRadius: Radius of the inner ring edge in km
      outerRadius: Radius of the outer ring edge in km
       rTilt: Ring tilt in ° relative to the planet's equator
       lNorth: Longitude of the north of the ring axis in ° (not required if rTilt=0°)
       colorLookup:(path of ring color map)

gasGiant:
# Used for gas planets like gas giants or ice giants
  oblateness: Required, the oblateness (polar flattening) of the gas planet, polar diameter = equatorial diameter * (1 - oblateness) 
  colorMap: (path of gas planet color map)
  atmosphere: - Required, gas planets without atmospheres are not possible! The zero-level "surface" pressure is, per definition, set to 1013.25 mbar.
    scaleDepth: ?

    km: ?
    g: ?
    waveLength: [R, G, B] - light scattering color of the atmosphere
    composition: [N2, O2, CO2, NO2, SO2, H2O, CH4, NH3, H2, He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe] - Optional, determines the composition of the atmosphere by weight numbers
    # Optional, defaults to Jupiters's atmosphere for gas planets
    # The volume fraction of each gas is calculated by dividing its weight number by the sum of all weight numbers
    # The partial pressure of each gas at a certain height is calculated by multiplying total atmospheric pressure with the volume fraction of the gas
