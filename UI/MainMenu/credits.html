                        Matthew is the creative force behind the Seed of Andromeda website, and he also assists in the design of the game. Between sessions working on the website's design he works on forum posts that have more text than a novel as well as having occasional cracks at developing systems for the website. Matthew is one of the more active devs on the forum and is always willing to offer his perspective on an idea!

                        Georg is a talented graphics artist and scientist! He started out by creating texture mods for Seed of Andromeda and was noticed for his skill and style! He is currently Studying Technical Chemistry in Austria, but enjoys making photorealistic textures in his spare time. No doubt his scientific background will aid Seed of Andromeda development!

                        Andreas is an incredibly talented hobby artist! He currently works in construction in Austria, and has studied graphic design. His incredible voxel modeling skills grabbed the attention of the Seed of Andromeda team thanks to his contributions on the forum! As Seed of Andromeda develops further, Andreas will be designing the 3D models and textures. He will also be helping design the voxel damage and animation systems!

He is known for his ability for eloquence and for understanding the wants and needs of the community with ease. He rules with a feathery fist of iron, so be warned - don't antagonise him, or a soft tickle may turn deadly.
