Adding a new Biome

	To add a new biome, add it to the BiomeList.txt, and then make sure to color some of the BiomeMap.png
	the appriproate color.

BiomeMap.png

	This is how the game determines what biome is where. X axis is temperature, and Y axis is rainfall. Temp
	and rainfall are generated by some noise functions that you can find in MandatoryNoise.SOANOISE. The biome
	that is selected is the biome whos color corresponds to the HexColor in the BiomeList.txt
	
How to test a single biome

	Simply color the entire BiomeMap.png to the color of the biome you want to test. Be sure to save a backup
	of the original BiomeMap.png.

Modifying a biome

	Surface_Block_ID: This determines what block is on the surface. This will change.
	Base_Tree_Chance: This is the percent chance of finding a tree on any givin x,y coordinate.
	Tree_List: Everything after this marker will be read as a possible tree. The tree must be defined in TreeData.txt
	Flora_List: Everything after this marker will be read as a possible flora. The flora must be defined in FloraData.txt
	Name: The name of the tree or flora to be looked up in the data file.
	Probability: The probability of finding the tree or flora on a givin x,y coordinate
		For trees, the probabilities of all the trees MUST add up to 2.0.
		For flora, the probabilities are the percent chance of finding that flora at an x,y coordinate. 
			this probability is multiplied by the corresponding flora noise function defined in FloraNoise.SOANOISE.
			If a flora noise function is not defined, there will be no multiplication and no grouping. The flora are
			evaluated in the order that they are specified, so a flora named at the top of the Flora_List: will have
			a higher chance of existing on that space, since any flora above it can override it.
