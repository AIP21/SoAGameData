##########  anim-file format specifications - last updated: 27.09.2014

  #  The anim-file uses the same filename as the animated texture


###  Internal structure of anim files:
  #  The file is required to use valid YAML syntax!

duration: (duration of one animation cycle in milliseconds)
fadeOutBegin: (passed time in milliseconds when fading out should start)    # this feature is optional
repetitions: (number of animation cycles)
xFrames: (number of frames the sprite sheet should be divided in x direction)
yFrames: (number of frames the sprite sheet should be divided in y direction)



####  Behavior of multi-tile block textures:
  #  Every frame should show the whole tile set, e.g. 12x4 tiles for the classic 8-way connection method

####  Behavior of base textures and overlays:
  #  Both can show independent animations and therefore use their own anim file
